'The Western Chokecherry is generally described as a perennial tree or
shrub. Its most active growth period is in the spring and summer. The
Western Chokecherry has green foliage and inconspicuous white flowers,
with an abundance of conspicuous red fruits or seeds. The greatest bloom is
usually observed in the spring, with fruit and seed production starting in
June and continuing throughout the summer months. Leaves are not
retained year to year. The Western Chokecherry has a short life span
relative to most other plant species and a rapid growth rate. At maturity, the
typical Western Chokecherry will reach a maximum height of 20 feet at 20
years of age.\n

'There are many species of currants in southeast Idaho but only one species
has fruit that actually tastes very good. The Golden Currant is so named
because of its display of golden yellow flowers in early spring. It is very
common along streams and in ravines and canyons and the seed is
commonly spread by birds so it can pop up just about anywhere. The fruit
can be golden â€“ orange, red or black on the same species, in fact stands of
Golden Currant are often found with all three colors of ripe berries next to
each other. Golden Currant berries are by far the tastiest to eat fresh, far
sweeter than most other currants. The Golden Currant has a long life span
relative to most other plant species and a moderate growth rate. At maturity,
the typical Golden Currant will reach a maximum height of 10 feet at 20
years of age.\n
